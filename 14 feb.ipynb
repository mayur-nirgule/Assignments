    "'''**Functions in the `threading` Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`run()` Function:**\n",
    "   - **Use:** Defines the code that will be executed when a thread is started. Developers can override this method in a custom thread class to specify the thread's behavior.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "     class MyThread(threading.Thread):\n",
    "         def run(self):\n",

    "     my_thread = MyThread()\n",

    "     ```\n",

    "2. **`start()` Function:**\n",
    "   - **Use:** Initiates the execution of the thread's `run()` method. It creates a new thread of control and calls the `run()` method asynchronously.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "     def print_numbers():\n",
    "         for i in range(5):\n",

    "     my_thread.start()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`join()` Function:**\n",
    "   - **Use:** Waits for the thread to complete its execution before proceeding with the rest of the program. It blocks the calling thread until the thread being joined terminates.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "     def print_numbers():\n",
    "         for i in range(5):\n",
    "             print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "     my_thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)\n",
    "     my_thread.start()\n",
    "     my_thread.join()  # Wait for the thread to finish before moving on\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`isAlive()` Function:**\n",
    "   - **Use:** Returns a boolean indicating whether the thread is currently alive or has completed its execution.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import threading\n",
    "     import time\n",
    "\n",
    "     def print_numbers():\n",
    "         time.sleep(2)\n",
    "         for i in range(5):\n",
    "             print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "     my_thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)\n",
    "     my_thread.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "     print(f\"Is the thread alive? {my_thread.isAlive()}\")\n",
    "     ```\n",

    "'''5)Advantages of Multithreading:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Concurrency:** Multithreading allows multiple threads to execute concurrently, making better use of CPU resources and improving overall program performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Responsiveness:** In GUI applications, multithreading helps keep the user interface responsive while background tasks are being executed in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resource Sharing:** Threads within the same process share the same resources, such as memory space, which can lead to more efficient resource utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Parallelism:** Multithreading enables parallel execution of tasks, which is beneficial for computationally intensive operations and tasks that can be split into independent subtasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Asynchronous Operations:** Multithreading is useful for handling asynchronous operations, such as I/O-bound tasks, without blocking the entire program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages of Multithreading:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complexity:** Multithreading introduces complexity to the program, making it more challenging to design, debug, and reason about. Coordination between threads can lead to race conditions and synchronization issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deadlocks:** Incorrect synchronization or locking mechanisms can lead to deadlocks, where two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Thread Safety:** Shared resources need to be accessed with care to avoid data corruption. Without proper synchronization, concurrent access to shared data can result in unpredictable behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Overhead:** Creating and managing threads comes with some overhead. Thread creation and context switching consume system resources, and too many threads can lead to diminishing returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Difficulty in Debugging:** Debugging multithreaded programs can be challenging due to the non-deterministic nature of thread execution. Issues may not always be reproducible, making it harder to identify and fix bugs.'''"

    "'''**Deadlocks:**\n",
    "A deadlock is a situation in multithreading or multiprocessing where two or more threads or processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource. Essentially, it's a circular waiting scenario where threads are stuck in a mutual hold-and-wait condition. Deadlocks can lead to a system or program becoming unresponsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Race Conditions:**\n",
    "A race condition occurs in multithreading or multiprocessing when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing of events, such as the order of execution of threads. It arises when multiple threads access shared data concurrently, and at least one of them modifies the data. The final outcome depends on the interleaving of the thread executions, and if not properly controlled, it can result in unpredictable and erroneous behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, deadlocks involve threads waiting for each other, leading to a standstill, while race conditions involve unpredictable outcomes due to the non-deterministic order of execution of concurrent threads. Both scenarios pose challenges in writing reliable and bug-free concurrent programs.'''"
