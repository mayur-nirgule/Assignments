    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an error occurs, Python raises an exception, allowing the program to handle the error gracefully and prevent it from crashing. Exceptions can be caused by various reasons, such as invalid input, file not found, or division by zero.\n",

    "Differences between Exceptions and Syntax Errors:\n",
    "Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors are errors in the code structure and grammar that prevent the interpreter from parsing the code.\n",
    "They are detected during the compilation or interpretation phase before the program runs.\n",
    "Examples of syntax errors include missing colons, mismatched parentheses, or using an invalid keyword.\n",
    "Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are runtime errors that occur during the execution of a program.\n",
    "They are not detected until the specific line causing the error is reached during program execution.\n",
    "Examples of exceptions include ZeroDivisionError (dividing by zero), FileNotFoundError (trying to open a non-existent file), and ValueError (unexpected data type).\n",
    "In summary, syntax errors are related to the structure of the code and are detected before the program runs, while exceptions are runtime errors that occur during program execution due to unforeseen circumstances or invalid operations.\n",

    "When an exception is not handled in a Python program, it propagates up the call stack until it either encounters a suitable exception handler or reaches the top-level of the program. If no handler is found, the program terminates, and an error message indicating the type of exception and the location where it occurred is displayed. This abrupt termination without proper handling can lead to unintended consequences, such as the program crashing or providing unexpected behavior to the user.'''\n",
