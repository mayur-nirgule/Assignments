#Q1. Which keyword is used to create a function? Create a function to return a list of odd numbers in the
#range of 1 to 25.
'''we use def keyword to creat a function'''

        if i%2!=0:
            print(i)

#Q2. Why *args and **kwargs is used in some functions? Create a function each for *args and **kwargs
#to demonstrate their use.
'''we used *args and **kwargs in a function for taking multipal inputes where *args is stored in the form of tupels and **kwargs store in the form of dictionry'''

def arg(*args):

'''Q3. What is an iterator in python? Name the method used to initialise the iterator object and the method
used for iteration. Use these methods to print the first five elements of the given list [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,
16, 18, 20]
In Python, an iterator is an object that implements the iterator protocol, which consists of the methods __iter__() and __next__(). An iterator must have these methods to be considered iterable.

__iter__() initializes the iterator object and returns it.
__next__() returns the next element in the sequence. When there are no more elements, it should raise the StopIteration exception.
Here's an example using the iterator protocol to print the first five elements of the given list:'''
'''
l=[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,16, 18, 20]

i=iter(l)

for _ in range (5) :
    print(next(i))
    
    
''''''Q4. What is a generator function in python? Why yield keyword is used? Give an example of a generator
function.'''

In Python, a generator function is a special kind of function that allows you to iterate over a potentially large sequence of data without creating the entire sequence in memory at once. It uses the yield keyword to produce a series of values in a lazy, on-demand fashion. The state of the generator function is maintained between successive calls to yield.

The yield keyword is used to pause the execution of the generator function and return a value to the caller. When the generator is called again, it resumes execution from where it was paused, allowing you to generate values one at a time.

Here's an example of a simple generator function that generates a sequence of squared numbers up to a given limit:


def square_generator(limit):
    for i in range(limit):
        yield i ** 2

# Using the generator function
my_generator = square_generator(5)

# Iterating over the generated values
for value in my_generator:
    print(value)


'''Q5. Create a generator function for prime numbers less than 1000. Use the next() method to print the
first 20 prime numbers.'''

Certainly! Here's an example of a generator function that yields prime numbers less than 1000, and then it uses the `next()` method to print the first 20 prime numbers:


def is_prime(number):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if number < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(number**0.5) + 1):
        if number % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def primes_generator():
    """Generator function for prime numbers less than 1000."""
    number = 2
    count = 0
    while count < 20:
        if is_prime(number):
            yield number
            count += 1
        number += 1
# Using the generator function with next() to print the first 20 primes
my_generator = primes_generator()

for _ in range(20):
    print(next(my_generator))



'''Q6. Write a python program to print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers using a while loop.'''
a=0

r=[]

while(c<=10):
      r.append(a)
      a,b=b,a+b


      c+=1

'''Q7. Write a List Comprehension to iterate through the given string: ‘pwskills’.
Expected output: ['p', 'w', 's', 'k', 'i', 'l', 'l', 's']'''

print(r)

'''Q8. Write a python program to check whether a given number is Palindrome or not using a while loop.'''
  original_number = number
    reversed_number = 0

    while number > 0:
        digit = number % 10
        reversed_number = (reversed_number * 10) + digit
        number = number // 10

    return original_number == reversed_number

# Input a number from the user
user_number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Check if the number is a palindrome
if is_palindrome(user_number):
    print(f"{user_number} is a palindrome!")
