    "'''Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.**\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating custom exceptions in Python, it is advisable to inherit from the `Exception` class or one of its subclasses. The `Exception` class is the base class for all built-in exceptions in Python, and it provides a structure and behavior that is expected from exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheriting from the `Exception` class ensures that your custom exception behaves consistently with other built-in exceptions. It also allows your custom exception to be caught by a broader `except` block that catches general exceptions, making your code more maintainable and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",

    "#ModuleNotFoundError` is more specific and is raised specifically when the module is not found, whereas `ImportError` can be raised for various import-related issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "'''Q6. List down some best practices for exception handling in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Specific Exception Handling:\n",
    "   Be specific in handling exceptions. Catch only the exceptions you expect and can handle, rather than using a generic `except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use `finally` for Cleanup:\n",
    "   Use the `finally` block to ensure that certain actions, such as closing files or releasing resources, are taken regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Avoid Bare `except`:\n",
    "   Avoid using a bare `except` clause, as it can catch unexpected exceptions and make debugging difficult. Instead, catch specific exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Logging Exceptions:\n",
    "   Consider logging exceptions using the `logging` module to maintain a record of errors, which can be useful for debugging and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Custom Exception Classes:\n",
    "   Create custom exception classes for your application to provide meaningful and descriptive error messages. Inherit from built-in exception classes for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Handle Exceptions Locally:\n",
    "   Handle exceptions at the appropriate level of your code. Avoid catching exceptions too early, as it may mask bugs or make troubleshooting more challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Raising Exceptions:\n",
    "   Raise exceptions to indicate errors or exceptional conditions in your code. This helps to communicate issues to other parts of your program or to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Graceful Degradation:\n",
    "   Design your code to gracefully degrade in the presence of errors. Provide default values or alternative paths when possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Understand Exception Hierarchy:**\n",
    "   Familiarize yourself with the Python exception hierarchy to better understand the relationships between different exception classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Keep it Simple:\n",
    "    Don't overcomplicate exception handling. Keep it simple and straightforward to maintain readability and avoid unnecessary complexity.'''"
